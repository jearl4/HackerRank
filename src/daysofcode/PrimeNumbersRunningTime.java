 * A prime is a natural number greater than that has no positive divisors other

 * Note: If possible, try to come up with a O(square root(n)) primality algorithm, or see what
 * sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be sure to check out
 * the Editorial after submitting your code!
